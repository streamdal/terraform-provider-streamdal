# streamdal_audience (Resource)

The `streamdal_audience` resource allows you to create, assign, and delete audiences.
Normally audiences are automatically announced when the SDK's `.Process()` method is called, but they
can be manually created.

## Example Usage

```hcl
terraform {
  required_providers {
    streamdal = {
      version = "0.1.2"
      source  = "streamdal/streamdal"
    }
  }
}

provider "streamdal" {
  token              = "1234"
  address            = "localhost:8082"
  connection_timeout = 10
}

resource "streamdal_audience" "billing_read_orders" {
  service_name   = "billing-svc"
  component_name = "kafka"
  operation_name = "read_orders"
  operation_type = "consumer"
}
```
